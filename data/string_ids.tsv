lp_0001	0	220668.lp_0001	220668	Lactobacillus plantarum	dnaA	Chromosomal replication initiation protein; Plays an important role in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. Binds to the origin of replication; it binds specifically double-stranded DNA at a 9 bp consensus (dnaA box): 5'-TTATC[CA]A[CA]A-3'. DnaA binds to ATP and to acidic phospholipids
lp_0002	1	220668.lp_0002	220668	Lactobacillus plantarum	dnaN	DNA-directed DNA polymerase III, beta chain; DNA polymerase III is a complex, multichain enzyme responsible for most of the replicative synthesis in bacteria. This DNA polymerase also exhibits 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. The beta chain is required for initiation of replication once it is clamped onto DNA, it slides freely (bidirectional and ATP- independent) along duplex DNA
lp_0004	2	220668.lp_0004	220668	Lactobacillus plantarum	lp_0004	Hypothetical protein
lp_0005	3	220668.lp_0005	220668	Lactobacillus plantarum	recF	Recombination protein F; The RecF protein is involved in DNA metabolism; it is required for DNA replication and normal SOS inducibility. RecF binds preferentially to single-stranded, linear DNA. It also seems to bind ATP
lp_0009	4	220668.lp_0009	220668	Lactobacillus plantarum	rpsF	30S ribosomal protein S6; Binds together with S18 to 16S ribosomal RNA
